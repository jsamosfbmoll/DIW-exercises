# 1 - Flexbox Boxes

Given the file flexbox-boxes.html and flexbox-boxes.css, add the CSS needed to get the layout that you can see in the file  captures/flexbox-boxes.png

Requirements:

1. Do not change the HTML !
2. Use flexbox CSS properties  whenever it’s possible
3. The images are aligned in the top of the card
4. The buttons are aligned in the bottom of the card

Tricks:

- use :nth-child() to identify the boxes individually if needed
- Use flex-grow to change the width of any element if needed (you don’t need to use flex-shrink nor the property flex )
