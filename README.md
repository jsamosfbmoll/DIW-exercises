# 1 - Flexbox Boxes

Given the file flexbox-boxes.html and flexbox-boxes.css, add the CSS needed to get the layout that you can see in the file  captures/flexbox-boxes.png

Requirements:

1. Do not change the HTML !
2. Use flexbox CSS properties  whenever it’s possible
3. The images are aligned in the top of the card
4. The buttons are aligned in the bottom of the card

Tricks:

- use :nth-child() to identify the boxes individually if needed
- Use flex-grow to change the width of any element if needed (you don’t need to use flex-shrink nor the property flex )

# 2 - Flexbox Cards

Given the file flexbox_cards.html and flexbox-cards.css, add the CSS needed to get the layout that you can see in the captures (captures folder) and the behavior you can see in [this video](https://www.loom.com/share/cf4cb32667f642478df7bc31f46d9fac).

Requirements:

1. Do not change the HTML and CSS, just add the CSS lines where indicated.
2. Use flexbox CSS properties  whenever it’s possible
3. The images are aligned in the top of the card
4. The buttons are aligned in the bottom of the card

Tricks:
