 1. **Header**
    - Set the logo image using background-image property 
    - “The Computer School” is an h1 and its font is double size of the body font size
 2. **Menu**
    - Create the sections of the menu using an unordered list modified (`<ul> <li>` ).  Tip: [https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_navbar.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_navbar.asp)
    - Every section of the menu has:
      - A font size 30% bigger than the body font
      - Vertical padding of 10px 
      - Horizontal padding of 20px

 3. **Pattern**
    - Use the background-image and the image available in images to create this pattern

 4. **Central image**
    - Use the image available in images
    - The image must have exactly the same proportions and look as in [here](docs/webpage.png) (Use the layout properties we’ve seen in class make it look exactly like that)

 5. **The Grades**

 6. **Angular, HTML, PHP, Javascript**
    - Use the tag `<img>` to insert the four images. 
    - The images must be horizontally centered
    - The texts under the images have a 20px size and are bold
    - On the left and on the right of every image there’s a single border of 1px

 7. **Footer**
    - Use only one `<div>`, two `<span>` and make use of position:absolute to put one text on the top left corner and the other text on the bottom right corner

 8. **Validate the HTML5 document**
    - You must always validate your ’HTML5 andl CSS3. You can use the extension V3C Validation for VSC

 9. **Create vendor prefixes**
    - Create the vendor prefixes (-moz, -ms, etc) for your CSS3.
